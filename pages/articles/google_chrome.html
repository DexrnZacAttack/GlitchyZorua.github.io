    <h1>Google Chrome is the WORST BROWSER</h1>

    <p>You may think, <i> "oh but chrome is not that bad", "I use a browser that is based on chrome, but is privacy respecting!"</i></p>

    <p>well, please just hear me out. you do realize that you are "technically" giving chrome more fame. Even if they stripped away all of the google shit, its still chrome... which encorages more people to use chrome more often. As a person who uses firefox alot, It creates this fork of "OH YOU SHOULD USE CHROME ILOPHRJDEWFKHSDLIFHSD" and "OH THIS BROWSER IS BASED ON CHROME, BUT PRIVACY BLAH BLAH BLAH" and i honestly don't give a shit if its privacy or not. weather the chromium based garbage browser is privacy or not, you shouldn't use it. Especially if its brave browser, brave is just.. so good, yet they have to use googles shitty browser engine.</p>
    <h1> But my browser has a free-vpn built in, so NYAH</h1>
    <p>Ah, so you are using operas vpn or some other browser that has a vpn? Screw that. Honestly, using a vpn is not that private. <b>They can literally see what you are doing, THROUGH THE VPN.</b>shocking amiright? If you want to know why VPNs are just... not that great in privacy. I won't give you much detail on why vpns are just not good sometimes. I am aware that VPNs sometimes are beneficial (I won't list them here.). That being said, if you insist on using a vpn, just get <a href="https://mullvad.net/">Mullvad VPN</a>.</p>
    <h1>But Google Chrome has a Private Window Feature!</h1>
    <p>So does firefox. You do realize that the Private Windows does not prevent other sites from telling what you are, right? What do you expect? They already know your ip, your browser agent, whoever the hell you are. It's a stupid excuse to not discontinue use Chrome. </p>
    <h1>But Google Chrome is fast!</h1>
    <p>If you really care about it being fast, just use <a href="https://www.palemoon.org/"> palemoon.</a></p><p>Chrome is also a ram eater.</p>
    <img src="https://retrojcities.neocities.org/pages/articles/images/000.png"><br><p>There is nothing to said else about chrome being a RAM eater. It just is.</p><br>
    <p>We aren't going to talk much about it, but yeah. you get the idea.</p>
    <h1> But this modifcation of chrome has a feature that no other browser ha-</h1>
    <p> honestly i don't care. </p>
    <h1> Consclusion </h1>
    <br>
    <p> there are many other reasons why chrome is just bad browser. but i'll stop here.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Chrome Sucks. And if you are still using it, my god. just stop </p>
    <br>
    <p> If that doesn't encourage you to stop using it, can i just mention something real quick that the ads for chromebook are terrible and super misleading?</p>

    <p> and yes, don't say that chromebook can't get viruses, cause it indeed, <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/blog/news/2018/12/yes-chromebooks-can-and-do-get-infected">can.</a></p>
    <p> you get the idea. Anyways, that wraps up for this poorly written blog post. see you later I guess.</p>
